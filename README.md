# IceCube-Low-Energy-Resolution-Limits
Resolution limits for low energy reconstruction in IceCube Upgrade (1-GeV-20GeV) &amp; DeepCore (5GeV-20GeV)

# Brief Description 
The study analyses the processes that limit the physics information in IceCube events and the contributions from these processes. These include the transverse shower spread, in-ice scattering, module resolutions (due to finite number of PMTs) and poissonian noise in modules.
